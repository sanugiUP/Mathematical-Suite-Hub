# SOA Project
This repository contains the code for a simple SOA Project with four actors - Authenticator, Service Publisher, Client, and Registry. This is part of an assignment submitted to Curtin University for the COMP3008 module in 2022.

Authenticator: It provides authentication services. The other actors, namely the client, service provider, and registry, communicate with the authenticator when they need to validate any information.

Service Provider: It offers mathematical services, such as addition, multiplication, generating prime numbers, and checking for prime numbers.

Registry: It provides basic service registration services for the providers and offers search services for the client.

Client: Its role is to invoke and test the services provided by the service provider.
